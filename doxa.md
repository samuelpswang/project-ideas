# Project Doxa

```text
Project Doxa is a community-based module review system to replace the Module 
Feedback Form system by Imperial's EESoc. Two basics rules will make this 
project work better than the current system:

    1) One cannot view another's reviews unless one submit at least one review. 
       Everyone needs to see advice and course information at some point, which 
       would allow the site to be more populated.
    2) Forum relies on the community to manage itself. The department regularly
       undergoes curriculum reform and material updates, i.e. no one can keep
       up. A system to allow people to review and update the curriculum outline
       as they are submitting feedback should keep the content up-to-date.

There are other miscellaneous features that could encourage uptake and make the
forum more rich in features. These will be documented in later project
specifications.
